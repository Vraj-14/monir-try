# Home Harvest

A mobile application designed to help students and working professionals discover and order affordable home-cooked tiffin meals from local providers.

# 📱 App Overview

Home Harvest is a hyperlocal Android application developed to modernize and digitize traditional offline canteen-based tiffin services. 
The app serves as a digital platform where local tiffin providers, especially small-scale canteens, can register, manage their menus, set pricing, and handle user orders in real time. 
Built using Java, Firebase Realtime Database, and Google Maps API, the application ensures secure authentication for both users and providers, real-time data synchronization, and intuitive menu and order management. 
Users can browse nearby tiffin services, view menus, and place daily or weekly subscription-based meal orders based on location proximity. By integrating geolocation features and real-time updates.
Home Harvest aims to create a seamless connection between users and local food providers, promoting affordability, convenience, and digital accessibility for small food businesses.
